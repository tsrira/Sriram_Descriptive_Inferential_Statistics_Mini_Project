# Mini Project: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

This project is designed to develop a foundational understanding of **Descriptive** and **Inferential Statistics**. The notebook covers key concepts such as:

- **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, Median, Mode
- **Measures of Dispersion**: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- **Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing**: Estimating population characteristics from sample data

## Objectives

- Understand key statistical definitions and concepts.
- Learn how to calculate descriptive statistics manually.
- Apply inferential methods like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
- Gain practical skills in interpreting and analyzing data to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Key Statistical Definitions**:
    - Population vs Sample
    - Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics
    - Parameter vs Statistic
    - Qualitative vs Quantitative Data

2. **Measures of Central Tendency**:
    - Mean, Median, Mode

3. **Variance and Standard Deviation**:
    - Sample Variance
    - Sample Standard Deviation

4. **Confidence Interval**:
    - Calculating 95% Confidence Interval for the population mean

5. **Hypothesis Testing**:
    - One-sample Z-test for hypothesis testing at a 5% level of significance

6. **Data Visualization**:
    - Boxplot and Five-number Summary for understanding data distribution and detecting outliers

## Dataset

This project uses synthetic datasets or publicly available datasets from platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Data for various problems is used to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis and computations.
- **Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab**: Interactive environments for running the code and visualizing the results.

## Skills Acquired

- **Data Analysis**: Gaining proficiency in basic statistical analysis and data processing techniques.
- **Statistical Methods**: Understanding and applying fundamental statistical methods like measures of central tendency, dispersion, and hypothesis testing.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful visualizations to better understand and interpret data.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developing the ability to apply statistical techniques to real-world problems and datasets.

## Packages Used

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization, built on top of Matplotlib.
- **SciPy**: For performing hypothesis testing and other statistical functions.

## Expected Outcomes

- Proficiency in computing and interpreting statistical measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- Practical understanding of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
- Ability to apply statistical methods to real-world datasets and analyze them.
